## Purpose

The purpose of this Wiki is to share our collective knowledge about procedures, methods and hacks that are useful for our research. Please contribute anything you think might be useful to others. We use Markdown to format the text in this Wiki. If you'd like to know more about Markdown, GitHub has a nice intro [here](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).
